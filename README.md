# Reddit Mini

As this project is frontend-focused, I will be using the unofficial JSON API 110 which doesnâ€™t need a backend. It allows us to make requests for read-only Reddit data directly from the browser.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Main Technologies:
